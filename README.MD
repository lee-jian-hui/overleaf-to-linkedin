## ‚ùì FAQ

### Can I fully automate LinkedIn uploads?

Not entirely. LinkedIn doesn't allow automatic resume/profile editing via public APIs. This tool simulates browser behavior using Playwright and pauses for manual CAPTCHA resolution. It's designed to help, not replace you.

### Can I use this offline?

Yes ‚Äî Ollama + this parser works 100% offline (aside from optional browser automation).

### Want a Web UI?

You can build one with Flask or Streamlit! Ask if you'd like a starter.
